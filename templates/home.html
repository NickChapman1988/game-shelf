                Game Shelf is a board game review site - a place for players new and old to find games they are
                interested in playing, read what others have said about those games,
                and rate your favourites!
            </p>
            <p class="welcome-text">
                Our Games page shows every single game ranked according to user ratings, so you can quickly find "the
                best" games!
            </p>
            <p class="welcome-text">
                If you've played something lately, why not leave a review for it? Registered users can add reviews for
                games and rate their favourites too!
            </p>
            <p class="welcome-text">
                And if you're in the market for a new game and find one you like the look of, all games have a 'Buy'
                link to where you can purchase from a friendly local games store!
